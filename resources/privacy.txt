# Briefings

I don't really wanna touch legal stuff, so this is a quick and simple privacy policy for this service.

# Data Collection and Purpose

+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Data               | Purpose                                          |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Your IP Address    | For debugging primarily. However, since it is    |
|                    | supposed to serve static files relevant to me,   |
|                    | I also use it as a security feature to inform me |
|                    | where and how my content is being used.          |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------+

* Note: You can opt out by enabling the "DNT" or "Sec-GPC" header on your requests.

# Data Retention

I don't plan on holding your data in any permanent storages, mostly because:
a. That's too much work for me.
b. I have no reason to keep them.

Your data will only exist in audit logs on my terminal for a brief amount of time and will promptly disappear upon server shutdown.

# Requesting Data Deletion

I can't really do much about it since I literally do not store your data in any permanent way, shape, or form. If you are concerned about your data being audit logged onto my terminal, please just shoot me a message on Discord or email. I can just clear the audit log specifically for you! .w.

# GDPR Compliance

I will try my best? Let me know if you are concerned about anything.

# Terms of Service

You can read more about it on the /terms.txt page.

# Updates on Privacy Policy

There's no way for me to alert you. I don't keep track of subscribers or any contact info whatsoever. There should be a lil' date at the end of this file if you wanna keep track when I update this file though.
